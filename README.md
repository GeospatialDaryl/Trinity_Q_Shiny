# Trinity Q Shiny

## Project Organization

The app leverages the [MWShiny package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mwshiny/vignettes/mws-vignette.html "CRAN Vignette") for multiwindow organization.  That structure uses three files to keep track of primary app resoures:

* ui_win
* serv_calc
* serv_out
